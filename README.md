# TIPE-Facial-recognition
This project was made for my TIPE project in 2023. It was made using VGG-16 in keras for real-time facial recognition. For the training and test dataset i used a private self-made dataset, that i labeled then  augmented using albumentations library.
To compare it's performance, i also created a second model using haar-cascade classifiers(pre-trained on facial detection)
Since this was my first introduction to Deepneural nets and CNNs, i made a CNN trained on the MNIST dataset to detect hand written numbers so i can understand more the hyperparametres of the CNN and their influence on pthe model performance.
